# On the structure of StateSummaries, Keys and Hashes

This brief document outlines the requirements and structure of StateSummaries, StateKeys and StateHashes for Snowman and Snowman++ VMs supporting state syncing.

State syncing allows safely rebuilding the VM state at a given height without the need to download and re-execute the whole block history from genesis.

## Supported operations and requirements

StateSummaries contains enough information to allow a VM to download, verify and rebuild its state. StateKeys must uniquely identify a StateSummary. StateHashes are simply StateSummary hashes.
The whole StateSummaries and StateKeys system **must** support the following operations:

1. Retrieval of last accepted StateSummary. This enables disseminating around StateSummaries frontiers upon request.
2. Retrieval of StateKey and StateHash from a StateSummary. This enables requesting votes by passing around a (StateKey, StateHash) pair, rather than the full StateSummary.
3. Verification of (StateKey, StateHash) validity and availability. This enables verifying and voting on a StateSummary by passing around StateKey only.

Moreover we impose the following requirements on StateSummaries and StateKeys:

0. State syncing requires availability of a block height index.  
1. (StateKey, StateHash) retrieval from its StateSummary must be allowed on any node, even a freshly create one with no previous state or index.
2. A StateSummary is uniquely associated with a block. We require the StateSummary to contain the BlockID, so that the full block may be downloaded at will.
3. A StateKeys must be as small as possible and (StateKey, StateHash) pair must be smaller than StateSummary.
4. The StateSummaries/StateKeys/StateHash system should work seamlessly on Snowman and Snowman++ VMs.
5. We want StateHash to be disseminated along StateKey for voting. This protects freshly created nodes from poisoned state summaries as, upon voting round, honest nodes can verify if the StateHash would not match and down-vote the summary.

## StateSummaries and StateKeys structure

The requirements above bring us to the following structure for StateSummaries, StateKeys and StateHashes:

|            | StateKey  | StateSummary                   | StateHash      |
|:----------:|:---------:|:------------------------------:|:--------------:|
| CoreVM     | height    | BlkID + height + Content       | SummaryHash    |
| ProposerVM | height    | ProBlkID + CoreVM_StateSummary | ProSummaryHash |

It can easily verify by inspection that the structure above allows support the required operations. Note that:

1. For any VM (CoreVM and ProposerVM) StateKeys and StateHashes can directly be derived from their StateSummary via hashing and concatenation operations, without accessing any state or index.
2. StateKey carries summary height rather than summary block ID to make it shorter. This comes at the cost of including both blkID and height into CoreVM StateSummary, which is optimal since StateKey are send around the network whenever they can substitute StateSummaries.
3. Note that (StateKey, StateHash) pairs are smaller then StateSummaries as long as SummaryHashes are smaller than SummaryContent.

## Detailing StateSyncableVM interface

State sync is implemented internally via the `StateSyncableVM` interface. `StateSyncableVM` supports the following operations:

1. `StateSyncGetLastSummary() -> StateSummary` to retrieve StateSummary frontier.
2. `StateSyncGetKeyHash(Summary) -> (StateKey, StateHash)` to extract StateKey and StateHash from StateSummary.
3. `StateSyncGetSummary(StateKey) -> StateSummary` to retrieve StateSummary associated with a given StateKey. This enables hash verification.
